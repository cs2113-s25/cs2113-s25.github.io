## Questions


### q
What is the difference between a functional and non-functional requirement?

#### s

Both must be testable and capture behavior of the system, but a non-functional requirement is usually some kind of "-ity" (usability, compatibility, security, speed, performance, etc.) that isn't generally something that a single developer could code up (like, for example, a widget on a GUI).

### q
Give two example functional requirements for Instagram.com.

#### s
Many options here;

- The system shall allow the user to upload a photo to their account.
- The system shall allow the user to 'like' photos of users they are following

### q
Give two example non-functional requirements for Instagram.com.

#### s
Many options here;

- The system shall encrypt all passwords stored in the database
- The system shall load each image within one second

### q
Draw a use case diagram for Instagram.com with at least three uses cases shown, where at least one use case extends another, and there are two actors.

#### s
Answers given in class.

### q 
Why has software engineering evolved to often embrace agile development models over waterfall ones?

#### s
It is generally impossible to obtain clear, consistent, and complete requirements up-front at the start of a software project, as the waterfall model assumes. Therefore, agile approaches can be used to have flexibility around the requirements discovery that inevitably happens during the software development process.

### q
Draw a diagram where there are at least two interconnected paths: a critical path, and at least one non-critical path.

#### s
Answers given in class.
