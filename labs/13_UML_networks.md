# Lab 13: Creating a UML diagram for the Client-Server lab

In this short lab, you will design your code for the upcoming lab using a UML diagram.

## Setup

Open the instructions for Lab 14 in another tab and take a look at the unit tests there.

## Drawing a UML diagram

In this lab you'll have a chance to do some system design before beginning to write your code. Using the provided unit tests, create a UML diagram with all the fields and methods necessary for the `Client` and `Server` classes.

While the unit tests will reveal what required public methods and fields, you should also be identifying and using private fields as part of designing your solution,

Using the notes from class, draw a UML diagram for both classes.


# Grading rubric and submission

Upload a PDF called lab13.pdf to BB to get graded.

You will be graded on the following:

|Item | Points |
|`Client` and `Server` classes are in the diagram as large rectangles | 4 |
|`Client` contains all appropriate methods with proper argument and return types and visibility |30 |
|`Client` contains fields for good OOP, with proper types and visibility | 18 |
|`Server` contains a `private` class to store clients | 20  |
|`Server` contains all appropriate methods with proper argument and return types and visibilitys | 24 |
|`Server` contains fields for good OOP, with proper types and visibility | 6 |
|TOTAL | 100 |
