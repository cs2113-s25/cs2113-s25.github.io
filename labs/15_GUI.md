# Lab 15: GUI Enigma

## Setup

Use your solutions from Lab 6 for this assignment (or see the `.class` files at the bottom of these instructions if you did not receive full credit for that lab):
* Comms.java
* Rotor.java
* Enigma.java

You will be writing two additional files from scratch, so you should create them now:
* EnigmaGUI.java
* EnigmaFrame.java

### Github setup

Use git, as discussed in Lab 0, to create a repo called `gitusername-lab15`, add these five files to it, and commit and push the changes to github. 

### Running your program

Run your lab on the command line by executing the following pipeline after compiling all your files:

```
java EnigmaGUI
```

### Testing your lab

There is no test script for this lab. Your grade is based on running your GUI and testing different input/outputs. 

# Enigma GUI

In this lab, you are going to write a GUI wrapper around the Enigma program you wrote earlier.

## Reviewing how Engima worked

If you recall, that lab required you to complete three classes


* `Rotor` : representing a rotor of an Engima Machine
* `Enigma` : representation of an Enigma Machine
* `Comms` : the communication (and main method) of an enigma machine.

To decrypt and encrypt, you provided the settings as command line arguments:

```
                  ,-- inner rotor initially positioned so X is on top
                  |,-- middle rotor initially positioned so # is on top
                  ||  ,-- outer rotor initially positioned so Y is on top
                  || /
java Comms 4 2 3 "X#Y" encrypt
           | | |
           | | `-- outer rotor is rotor 3
           | `-- middle rotor is rotor 2
           `-- inner rotor is rotor 4
```

And then the input and output on the command line

```
~/$ java Comms 1 2 3 "###" encrypt
AAA
NDU
```

```
~/$ java Comms 3 1 2 "SAT" encrypt
DO#YOUR#BEST#AND#KEEP#ON#KEEPIN#ON
ACAAFAEOZFWKBQKPXZOGIKXTNPEBDXWQCZ
```

```
~/$ java Comms 5 2 4 "EST" decrypt
CSHIAWDFGDCOE#EZKJHRWAZDDCBCILON#PKUJEXEXSHINZ
THE#NATIONAL#ANIMAL#OF#SCOTLAND#IS#THE#UNICORN
```

## Building a GUI

The purpose of this lab is to wrap all that functionality into a GUI. For example, here is a screenshot of a GUI implementation that you should be able to achieve:

<img src="/images/Engima-GUI.png" 
alt="Enigma GUI" 
width="60%" 
style="display: block;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;"/>

You must use the following GUI elements in completing this lab
* `JComboBox` : for selecting the rotor numbers
* `JTextField` : for selecting the start of the rotors
* `JTextArea` : for providing input to and output from Enigma
* `JButton` : for selecting encrypt or decrypt
* `JLabel` : for including other text references, such as "Inner" or "Middle"

You can use any layout scheme you want for including these elements, but it should look something similar to the screenshot and be obvious in how to use it. For reference, I only used the `BorderLayout`, but you may find other layouts effective here.  (*Hint: you may also find it useful to create additional `JPanel`s which organize different parts of your GUI, like the settings and the input/output areas.*)

## Requirements

<div class="requirement">

You must submit *at least* two classes
* `EnigmaGUI.java` : the main method for launching the GUI
* `EnigmaFrame.java` : the JFrame that contains the GUI

You may also create additional classes as you see fit to complete this assignment. 

You should use your completed Enigma code from Lab 6, but if you did not fully finish that assignment, you can use the following class files to complete this assignment. (Note that only compiled version of `Enigma` and `Rotor` are provided, but the full source of `Comms` is available.)
* [Enigma.class](/src/Enigma.class)
* [Rotor.class](/src/Rotor.class)
* [Comms.java](/src/Comms.java) 

These class files are included in the starter code for your repository. If you want to use your own version, copy over your `Enigma.java` and `Rotor.java` file and compiles those, which will replace the existing class files.

# Grading rubric and submission

Tar your files into a folder `lab15.tar` and submit the tarfile to BB for grading.

You will be graded on the following:

|Item | Points |
|your git logs show comments that helpfully and meaningfully describe what updates you were committing | 5 |
|your git logs show evidence that you committed code at least once during the Lab4 lab | 2 |
|your git logs show at least five commits that are all at least ten minutes apart | 3 |
|three `JComboBox`s are used to select the roto numbers | 10 |
|a `JTextField ` is used to input the three starting characters | 10 |
|two `JTextArea `s are used to provide input/output to the GUI for the encrypt/decrypt tasks | 10 |
|two `JButton `s are used to select encrypt vs decrypt | 10 |
|five `JLabel `s are used to label all the fields shown in the example | 10 |
|one or more `JPanel`s has been used to create a visually-pleasing layout like in the example image | 10 |
|the functionality from the command-line version of this lab is preserved identically in the GUI (i.e. it works for all inputs) | 30 |
|TOTAL | 100 |
