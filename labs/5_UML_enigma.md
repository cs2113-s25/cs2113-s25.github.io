# Lab 5: Creating a UML diagram for the Enigma lab

In this short lab, you will design your code for the upcoming Enigma lab using a UML diagram.

## Setup

Open the instructions for the [Engima lab](lab/6_enigma) in another tab and read over them, taking note of:

* The three classes you need to write and/or work with
* The contents of each (skeleton) class

## Drawing a UML diagram

Using the notes from class, draw a UML diagram for all the three classes associated with the Engima lab. You'll be graded using the rubric below.


# Grading rubric and submission

Upload a PDF called lab5.pdf to BB to get graded.

You will be graded on the following:

|Item | Points |
|three classes are in the diagram as large rectangles | 2 |
|all methods, including constructors, appear in the diagram, with proper visibility, arguments, and return types | 72 (8 pts each) |
|all fields appear in the diagram, with proper visibility types | 16 (4 pts each) |
|correct relationship between classes drawn (including arrow direction) | 10 (5 pts each) |
|any extra fields, methods, or relationships | minus 5 pts each |
|TOTAL | 100 |
