	Complete the template below such that you will provide code to solve the following problems. 
	<br>
	<table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1>
		<tr>
			<td>Write test cases in the template below to find the unknown bug in code that performs the following: a method called <code>
			checkCode</code> which will check if a string entered by the user is a valid item code or not. A valid item code will have the following 
			characteristics:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>It will start with an integer between 1 and 999 (without preceding zeros).</li>
				<li>Next, a period will appear.</li>
				<li>One or more words composed of letters, separated by spaces, will appear. Each word must be capitalized.</li>
				<li>The last word is followed by one or more spaces.</li>
				<li>Finally, the code will end with an optional five digit number.</li>
			<ul></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<br>
	Follow the format of each test case according to the example:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Start a test case with "</li>
		<li>On the same line, include the function name, followed by a space, followed by the input</li>
		<li>Finish the first line by adding a ", followed by a comma, followed by a newline.</li>
		<li>On the next line, you'll include the expected output: start with a ", followed by either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>,
		followed by a ", followed by a comma.</li>
		<li>Don't change any of the other lines in the file! Make sure you're only adding in lines.</li>
	</ul>	<br>
